Explain how you have structured your report/dashboard to deliver that impact.

Pages are showing the most important information that we wanted to show and visualize. The information will be easily identifiable and located on the pages which plays important part in visualizing. The Audience will also have space to find other interesting information that can lead to further analysis if needed. 
All pages start with title which explains what we were looking for in the data and some of them are interactive.


Explain for each of your visualizations.

Page 1 starts with 2 interactive parts where each selection is showing a relevant visualisation and explanation allowing the audience to gasp the information effectively. First slices is adjusting the date and the second slicer is selecting a type of meat. 
These choices will affect the two bar charts bellow which show the volume of exported and imported meat by Country. In the top right corner is a filled map showing the countries from which used the data so we can get the picture where those countries are placed on the map and the size of the countries.  
Page two is showing which countries have imported most of the toxic meat last year. And  It starts with a slicer where we pick a type of meat and see on the map below size of the bubbles. The bigger bubble the more of toxic meat was imported last year. On the map in the below left corner is number of grams of toxic meat imported last year.
On the page three focus was put to answer the question to find a date when least amount of meat was exported and the least amount of volume. The calculation has been made from 3 measures that I combined later. First one was made by SUM of meat price times SUM of volume exported. Next measure was to help me get the right Trade discount by subtracting every value with 1. Finally, I had the measure Where I multiplied 2 previous ones and got the value of meat exported for every day of the year 2022 by country. 
The values had been put in an edited table in order to show all the important digits. By interacting with table, we can show the wished value.
Next to the table is a Column chart that shows profit of all the countries. Profit was counted by subtracting the Sender budget with total Value exported. 


Why you believe your technical analysis is correct and what steps you took to confirm your results.

The measures were manually checked on calculator by using one value from each table and the result we wanted to achieve was correct most od the times. If not, we would know after we checked the calculation.
